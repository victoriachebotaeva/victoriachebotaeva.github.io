I am a [Teaching Fellow](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/victoria-chebotaeva/) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Southern California. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of South Carolina, where my research focused on mathematical modeling of epidemics, with an emphasis on SEIR models incorporating cross-diffusion dynamics and Erlang-distributed delays.  

I am deeply committed to inclusive and student-centered teaching. During my time at South Carolina, I served as an [Instructional Peer Mentor](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/beyond_classroom/pmp/past-mentors.php) for first-year Ph.D. students beginning their teaching journeys. I also worked with the [TRIO program](https://communities.usc.edu/educational-partnerships/trio-programs/), supporting first-generation college students through academic coaching and mathematics instruction.  

My current interests include alternative assessment methods, active learning, and building equitable learning environments in undergraduate mathematics classrooms.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
