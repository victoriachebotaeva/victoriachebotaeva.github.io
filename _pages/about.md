I am a [Teaching Fellow](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/victoria-chebotaeva/) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Southern California. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of South Carolina, where my research focused on mathematical modeling of epidemics, with an emphasis on SEIR models incorporating cross-diffusion dynamics and Erlang-distributed delays.  

I am deeply committed to inclusive and student-centered teaching. During my time at South Carolina, I served as an [Instructional Peer Mentor](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/beyond_classroom/pmp/past-mentors.php) for first-year Ph.D. students beginning their teaching journeys. I also worked with the [TRIO program](https://communities.usc.edu/educational-partnerships/trio-programs/), supporting first-generation college students through academic coaching and mathematics instruction.  

My current interests include alternative assessment methods, active learning, and building equitable learning environments in undergraduate mathematics classrooms.
